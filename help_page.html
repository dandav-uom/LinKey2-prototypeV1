         <h3>How to use LinKey2</h3>
<p>LinKey2 works very similarly to the original Stäubli key at araneae.nmbe.ch and is based on the same data collected by Anna Stäubli. It takes user input describing a specimen and tries to suggest possible identifications, narrowing down the options as more characters are specified. The main difference to the classical interface is that the tool assigns probabilities to a list of 1530 species according to how likely each is to be the species in question, using formal Bayesian calculations of posterior probabilities, instead of making binary yes/no decisions for each species.</p>

<p>On the main page there are three columns: "Characters", "Selected" and "Species probabilities". 
"Characters" contains a list of descriptions you can use to describe the species in question. Clicking on them will show a drop-down menu with choices for each character. After selecting one it will be moved to the "Selected" column. Descriptions can be entered in any order, and not all descriptors need to be used. It is up to the user how many characters they wish to enter and in which order. Typically, the more characters are entered the more likely it is that the tool will suggest the correct identification. Clicking on the question mark boxes will display a help pop up showing examples (in the final version all descriptions will have examples). </p>

<p>The "Selected" column shows the currently selected description of a specimen. If you would like to change your selections, rather than reset you can simply click the remove button of an individual character.</p> 

<p>The "Species probabilities" column displays all the species available in this version of the tool. They are ranked in descending order according to their current posterior probability (displayed as a percentage). If more than one species has the same probability, they will be shown in alphabetical order. Clicking on a species name will take you to the summary page for that species, displaying its values for the various descriptors used in this tool.</p> 

<p>
A full list of the species used in this key can also be accessed by clicking on the species index link at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
The araneae link will take you to the original key/data that this tool is based on. 
</p>


<h2>Basic vs. Advanced</h2>
<p>
Near the top of the main page, there is a button that can display either "Basic" or "Advanced". By default, Basic is selected. The Basic option allows for some errors in character description by the user. The "Advanced" option is for professionals or users who are confident in their ability not to make many errors. In "Advanced" mode, correct identification will likely take fewer inputs, but errors will have a greater chance to lead to misidentification. To access "Advanced" mode, simply click on it. </p>
